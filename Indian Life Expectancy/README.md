# Analysis of Life Expectancy in Indian States

This project analyzes life expectancy data for different Indian states to gain insights.

## Datasets
Links:
- [India Life Expectancy.csv](https://github.com/VinayMeesaraganda/Python-Projects/files/11165458/India.Life.Expectancy.csv)
- [Pollution.csv](https://github.com/VinayMeesaraganda/Python-Projects/files/11165461/Pollution.csv)


## Data Overview

The data contains:

- Life expectancy, literacy rate, undernutrition data for 21 Indian states
- Pollution data (SO2, NO2, PM10) for the states

## Analysis Steps

- Load and inspect the data
- Check and handle missing values 
- Label encode categorical features
- Identify and remove outliers
- Merge the two datasets
- Explore distributions and correlations using visualizations like boxplots, pairplots, heatmaps etc.
- Use statistical functions to analyze features
- Implement custom functions using args and kwargs

## Key Insights

- Southern states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu have highest life expectancy
- Literacy rate is positively correlated with life expectancy
- Pollution levels are higher in landlocked states

The analysis provides a good understanding of factors affecting life expectancy and their correlations. The techniques used can be applied to other datasets as well.
